# FACE MOOD JUKEBOX #
This project proposes a novel jukebox recommendation system for detecting the facial emotion of the person. By leveraging Gemini-pro-vision, an AI tool excelling in facial emotion recognition, the system aims to recommend songs that resonate with a user's current mood. Imagine feeling joyful - the system would analyze your facial expressions and curate an upbeat playlist to amplify your mood. Conversely, for someone feeling down, the system would recommend soothing music. Additionally, the system considers user language preference, ensuring recommendations not only match emotional state but also cater to cultural background and musical tastes. This research paper delves into the system's details, exploring Gemini-pro-vision's functionalities and the system's architecture. We then discuss the potential benefits of this system, emphasizing its ability to create a deeper connection between music and our emotional well-being.
